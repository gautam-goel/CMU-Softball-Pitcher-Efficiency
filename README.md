# CMU-Softball-Pitcher-Efficiency

As part of the Sports Analytics Capstone (36-493) at Carnegie Mellon University, I worked with the CMU Softball team to provide insight into their piching performance. The above files are our project poster (an overview of the project) and our final presentation (a deeper dive into each step in our project). 

The RShiny App, datasets, and player names have been ommitted due to privacy reasons. However, if you are curious about the project and would like to learn more, please reach out!
